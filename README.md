- Hello there. You've reached @anarchy1923's github. 
- I like to work in Unity, and am fascinated by Reinforcement Learning in particular and Machine learning in general. Artificial Intelligence fascinates me. I'm fascinated by robots, computers, machine learning, and reinforcement learning, and would like to dabble more with it when time provides. I'm also fascinated by History, Geography, Polity, and all that is around us. I believe in a world where the weak, downtrodden and oppressed people are protected, not by welfare but by opportunities, where they are shown the light, and the path that takes them through to the other side. I believe in suffering, and the change that it brings in a man. I believe in growing through it. I believe that I have an obligation to tell my story to people, so that people who might be facing similar situations that I faced, can know that No dream is big enough, and that anything is possible. I know my calling lies on the other side, and I keep one foot after the other, obsessed, with intent, and with a belief that God is watching over me. 
- I’m fascinated with learning, and I am interested in martial arts, chess, trance, space, reading, neuroscience & studying the human mind. 
- I'm on Discord as anarchy1923#1549, on YouTube as DROIDRUSH, you can find me on twitter @padfoot_07__.
