- 👋 Hi, I’m @anarchy1923
- 👀 I’m fascinated with learning & am interested in martial arts, chess, trance, podcasting, neurobiology & the science of learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Reinforcement learning, Machine learning in general & artificial intelligence. To be honest, I'd like to learn more about them because its fun, but the moment requires me to learn Polity, Economy, History, Geography, Science & Tech, International Relations, Internal Security, Environement & a lot more so I'm doing just that. I know my calling lies on the other side, so that's what I'm going to do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning, Game Development & Unity. 
- 📫 How to reach me : I'm on Discord as anarchy1923#1549, on YouTube as DROIDRUSH, you can find me on twitter @padfoot_07__.
